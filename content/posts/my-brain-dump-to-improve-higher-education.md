These are my notes when I was thinking on how can I build to a college of my dreams.
I don't know when I will be able to do it, since
- it will definitely require funding,
- it would take really long time to make a different kind of college mainstream,
- amount of money to be made are probably not justifiable with the efforts that
anyone will have to put.  I will feel as if I am doing a disservice if I try to
the society squeeze more money

So, I am putting all of my raw thoughts here, so if someone with superpowers ever
gets lost on this corner of the internet, there is a tiny chance that this will
become a reality. For more context read my previous two blogs [Faults in our higher education system](https://medium.com/@kishansagathiya/faults-in-our-higher-education-system-ad68bc0abe9b) and [And how to fix them](https://medium.com/@kishansagathiya/and-how-to-fix-them-6372a6a49efe)
