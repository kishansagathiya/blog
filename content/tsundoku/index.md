“Tsundoku,” a Japanese expression written with kanji characters that stand for “pile up” and “read,” refers to a habit many bookworms are guilty of: 

_They buy books because they want to read them but never get around to doing so, consequently amassing a substantial collection of unread books that just keep collecting._

This is an attempt to not indulge in Tsundoku and read the books that I have. I will try to mark the books that I read using pensil and put highlights or summary in this space.

Some of the books that I own are as follows
